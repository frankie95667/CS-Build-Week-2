some techniques for relaxing during the interview:

Pretend you already have the job and the interviewer is a coworker who came to you for help on a difficult problem.

* If you already had the job, there's no stress
* Reframes the situation from an interview to just problem-solving
* Puts you in a cooperative mindset
* It forces you to *teach* the problem and solution

UPER is the key to do it all
----------------------------

### Understand
* Ask questions about the problem
* Dialog
* Rephrase the promblem back to the interviewer in your own words
* Teaching the "what" of the problem to the interviewer 

### Plan
* Come up with multiple plans, if possible
* Don't ignore the naive plans
* Think in big concepts, not code

### Execute
* If your're describing existing code:
    * interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
    * Point out interesting things in it
    * Make sure it's well commented and looks good

* If you're writing new code:
    * Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
    * Actually code it up at this point

### Reflect
* What could we have done better?
* Future directions and features
* If you made any mistakes, point them out with the solutions
